### v1.0

My very first attempt at getting into web development. This project was made
using the very basics:

- HTML
- CSS
- "Javascript" (a.k.a jQuery).

##### Known Issues

If you can go between sections fast enough, you can break what is displayed. I
haven't really reviewed my code since I first got it up and running but it's
probably because I didn't know that I was using async methods to handle my
animations.
